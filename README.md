### Hey! Thanks for joining. Let‚Äôs make it happen!

Let me introduce myself to you... 

***I'm Maximiliano Imanol Aguer*** - a full-stack developer and student with a long-term focus on Web Development, Investing, and Finance. I‚Äôm constantly working on projects that help me learn, grow, and gain deeper insights.

'To keep it brief... I see myself as an enthusiast right now, but a good archetype is not created in a week or a day; it is created little by little, day by day. Protracted and patient effort is needed... and knowing that, I foresee lots of advancement in my overall skills and knowledge.' 

I'm sure you're more experienced than I am, so I‚Äôd appreciate any advice you have. I'm open to learning from you.
